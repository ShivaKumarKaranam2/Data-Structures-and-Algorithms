"""
Kâ€™th Smallest Element in Unsorted Array

Given an array arr[] of N distinct elements and a number K, where K is smaller than the size of the array. Find the K'th smallest element in the given array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3 
Output: 7

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 4 
Output: 10
